## Components required 

Arduino, 25 led's, connecting wires, 5 resistors, breadboard.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are more ways you can build an lcd matrix. Here, I am using the concept of multiplexing. 

## How to Multiplex an LED matrix? 

Multiplexing is the technique employed to operate LED matrices. By multiplexing, only one row of the LED matrix is activated at any one time. This approach is required because one end of the LED (either the anode or the cathode) is tied to a single row.

## Connections 

Short all the cathodes of the led that are connected in a row and then connect it to a resistor(220 ohm) and then to the digital pins of your intrest respectively. In the same manner short all the anodes and connect it to any digital pin respectively. 

The ciruit diagram and link is given below.
